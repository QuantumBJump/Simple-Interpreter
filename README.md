# Simple-Interpreter

This is my program-along of Ruslan Spivak's [Let's Build A Simple Interpreter](https://ruslanspivak.com/lsbasi-part1/), in which he shows how to write a Pascal interpreter in Python.

I won't be accepting any pull requests, as I'm doing this for my own learning, and letting people do it for me would defeat the object.
